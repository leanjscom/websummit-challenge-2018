# Are you a JavaScript ES6 expert?

The goal of this exercise is to practice some cool ES6 features by doing TDD. This kind of practice is known as Koans.

To solve this kind of exercise you don't have to know unit testing, since you won't write any test and the output of the tests will be rendered in the terminal. However, it might be helpful for some people to look at the test itself to understand what has to be implemented in every case.

## Get started

If you have yarn:
`git clone git@github.com:leanjscom/es6-exercise.git && cd es6-exercise && yarn install`

If you have npm:
`git clone git@github.com:leanjscom/es6-exercise.git && cd es6-exercise && npm install`

## Exercise
- run `npm test` or `yarn test`, by default it will run all the tests.
- Once all the tests pass, you'll be an ES6 expert! :)
